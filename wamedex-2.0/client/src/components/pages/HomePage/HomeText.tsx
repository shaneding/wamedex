        We hope that our service can contribute to the fight against this global pandemic by helping
        policy makers and clinicians make better-informed decisions and by helping researchers
        generate new insights.

      <Paragraph>
        To properly calibrate expectations, our system relies on inference using
        computationally-expensive neural models at search time, and thus the interface is not as
        responsive as we'd like. We're working hard on making the system more robust and faster, so
        please be patient! In terms of answer quality, the results are better than keyword search
        overall (at least in our opinion), but as is often the case with neural networks, sometimes
        the output can leave users scratching their heads. We're also working hard on improving the
        answers!
